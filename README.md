Santas-Little-Helper---Android
==============================

This is an ongoing Application for Android devices running Android 2.1 and above. Once installed, this App goes into stealth mode and is hidden from the user. It reads incoming and outgoing text messages and then sends a copy of them to a pre-defined email address for observation. It also listens for special keywords in each incoming text, and can perform special actions on the device e.g. emailing the devices current co-ordinates without the user knowing anything about it.
